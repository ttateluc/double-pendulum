### Simple Synopis
A double pendulum is chaotic. This term is the subject of a lot of handwaving in the popular media, but it's pretty simple.

In order to predict the behavior of a system, we need two things: an understanding of the mechanics of that system and knowledge of the initial conditions of that system. Put simply, in order to predict the state of the double pendulum as some time in the future, we need to know how double pendulum systems work and what the system was like when it started.

We know how double pendulums work â€“ this is no barrier. The math isn't really that complicated, although like many physical systems it's expressed most naturally using calculus or differential equations.

The trick is knowing the initial conditions. We can only know them to a finite level of precision, and any slack or error in our initial measurements will cause our calculations to deviate from reality. To predict the behavior of the system with great precision and/or over a long period of time, we will need very precise measurements.

When we say that the double pendulum is chaotic, what we mean is that it is especially sensitive to errors in our initial measurements. Errors will accumulate very quickly, so that predicting the precise state of the system slightly further into the future requires significantly more precise measurements. Thus, the practical limits of our ability to measure the system's initial state put a severe practical limit on our ability to predict the system's behavior.
